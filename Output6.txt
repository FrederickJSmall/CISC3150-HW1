The purpose of this application is to see if two circles touch,intersect,overlap
 or one contains another

Please select a point and radius in the form of x,y,r
Circle 1 - X,Y,R Coord-> 8,8,1
PointX=8 ,PointY=8 ,Radius=1

X=8,Y=8,R=1

Please select a point and radius in the form of x,y,r
Circle 2 - X,Y,R Coord-> 8,8,12
PointX=8 ,PointY=8 ,Radius=12

X=8,Y=8,R=12

Distance between points=0.0
Combined Radius=11.0
Once circle completely conatins another
